Atmel SAME70 Project for our embedded computing class.

It's basically supposed to be a pen drive with constant access to a cloud storage host, so that you may take 
all your cloud files wherever you go, and not depend on any smartphone or computer integration.

It`s still an ongoing project, so expect a lot of changes coming to this repository.
